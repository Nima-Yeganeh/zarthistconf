During the fourteenth to sixteenth centuries, art in Germany underwent significant transformations, reflecting both internal developments and external influences from neighboring regions, particularly Italy during the Renaissance. This period is marked by the transition from medieval Gothic art to Renaissance art, with German artists gradually adopting Italian Renaissance styles and techniques.

### Late Medieval Period (Late 14th Century)

- **Gothic Art**: In the late 14th century, German art was heavily influenced by Gothic style, characterized by its pointed arches, flying buttresses, and intricate stone carvings. Albrecht Dürer's early works show the influence of Gothic art, although he later moved towards more naturalistic representations.

### Early Renaissance Period (15th Century)

- **Italian Influence**: With the spread of the Renaissance from Italy, German artists began to incorporate Renaissance ideals such as perspective, realism, and the celebration of the individual. However, the adoption of Renaissance styles was gradual and varied across different regions of Germany.

- **Albrecht Dürer**: One of the most influential German artists of this period, Dürer bridged the gap between the late Gothic and early Renaissance styles. His engravings, such as "The Knight, Death, and the Devil" (1513), demonstrate his mastery of detail and composition.

### High Renaissance Period (16th Century)

- **Northern Mannerism**: As the Renaissance spread northward, German art evolved into what is known as Northern Mannerism, characterized by elongated figures, complex compositions, and an emphasis on emotion over realism. Hans Baldung Grien, a pupil of Dürer, is noted for his expressive use of color and his depictions of women and nature.

- **Reformation Impact**: The Protestant Reformation had a profound impact on German art, influencing religious iconography and the depiction of biblical scenes. Martin Luther's rejection of Catholic practices led to changes in church art, with a focus on simplicity and directness.

### Conclusion

From the late 14th to the 16th century, German art experienced a dynamic evolution, influenced by both internal developments and external forces, especially the Italian Renaissance. Artists like Albrecht Dürer and Hans Baldung Grien played pivotal roles in shaping German art during this period, blending Gothic traditions with Renaissance innovations and adapting to the religious and cultural shifts brought about by the Reformation.
